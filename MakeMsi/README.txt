If you wish to build an installer, you'll need MakeMsi
<http://dennisbareis.com/makemsi.htm>

Edit these files with your info, and replace the ones in your Program Files\MakeMsi:
  * Company.mmh
  * DEPT.mmh

Keep in mind that if you redistribute your own installer, I kindly ask you to keep a link to my donation box at <http://www.rainChu.com.>, unless, in good faith, you believe
that you have surpassed the official codebase with your own. (This is not a licensing requirement, but please, with a cherry on top? ^_^)
